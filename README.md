# PhotoCopyCircuit
This is the design for the deeds simulatoins of the photocopy machine. We have used 3 JK flip-flop for the 3-bit count-up program with a negative triggered clock. 3 XOR gate, 3 inverters and 1 NAND gate for the 3-bit comparator. There are 2 switches for Power and Wi-Fi. Also, there are 3 switches for password.
